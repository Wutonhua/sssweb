                    <h2>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a crucial tool for students in the United States seeking financial assistance to pursue higher education. Managed by the <a style="color:#bf5c5c" href="https://www.ed.gov/" target="black">U.S. Department of Education</a> , FAFSA enables students to apply for various forms of federal financial aid, including grants, loans, and work-study programs. By gathering information about a student's or their family's financial situation, <span style="color:#bf5c5c">such as income and assets</span>, FAFSA calculates the <span style="color:#bf5c5c">Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</span>, which determines the student's eligibility for aid. 
                    </h2>
                    <h2>The FAFSA is available annually <span style="color:#bf5c5c">starting on October 1st</span> for the upcoming academic year. Students are encouraged to fill out the FAFSA as soon as possible after it becomes available, as some aid programs have limited funds distributed on a <span style="color:#bf5c5c">first-come, first-served basis. </span>
                    </h2>
                    
                    <h2>All types of students who are considering pursuing higher education should fill out the FAFSA. This includes:
                    </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. High school seniors planning to attend college or university after graduation.</li>
                        <li>2. Current college students who are continuing their education.</li>
                        <li>3. Graduate students pursuing advanced degrees.</li>
                        <li>4. Non-traditional students returning to school after a break.</li>
                        <li>5. Students attending vocational or technical schools.</li>
                        <li>6. Students pursuing certificates or other non-degree programs.</li>
                    </ol>   
                    
                    
                    <h1 class="css"><a href="https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/" target="blank">CSS - College Scholarship Service Profile</a></h1>
                    <h2>The CSS Profile, unlike the FAFSA, is an additional financial aid application required by some colleges and universities in the United States, particularly <span style="color:#bf5c5c">private institutions</span>. Here are the types of students who may need to fill out the CSS Profile:
                    </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. Students applying to colleges or universities that require the CSS Profile.</li>
                        <li>2. Students seeking additional financial aid opportunities</li>
                        <li>3. International students</li>
                        <li>4. Students with complex financial situations</li>

                    </ol>  
                    <h2>It's essential for students to check the financial aid requirements of each college or university they are applying to determine whether they need to submit the CSS Profile in addition to the FAFSA. Additionally, students should <span style="color:#bf5c5c">be aware of deadlines</span>, as it may differ from institution to institution.
